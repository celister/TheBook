This is where I talk about the time that I was working on the fringes of our big push forward for HP Openview and I was then moved to work on something called - nmm for PC and then that became the port of Windows NT to HP's PARISC.
* That switch from creating PC software to play in a UX world to creating UX software to play in a PC world
* That time I helped create the software to identify the health of a PC back to the UX box
* That time I was called into a room to inform us we were going upstairs
* That time when I worked on creating a Windows NT debugger that understood HP PA-RISC assembly, and yes, I barely had a PA-RISC assembly book
* That time when I wanted to work corraboratively with a co-worker and he was too good for it
* That time I was dinged for working too much on my own
* That time I was told I was developing the debugger too slow
